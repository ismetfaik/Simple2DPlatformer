# Character Design Concepts

## Current Implementation
- Blue rectangle (20x40 pixels)
- Simple ColorRect node
- No animations

## Proposed Human-like Characters

### Option 1: Simple Stick Figure
- Minimalist design with head, body, arms, legs
- Easy to animate
- Clear movement representation

### Option 2: Pixel Art Character
- 16x32 pixel sprite
- Classic platformer style
- Detailed but still readable

### Option 3: Simple Humanoid Silhouette
- Solid color human shape
- Modern flat design aesthetic
- Smooth animation potential

## Animation States Required
1. **Idle**: Standing still, subtle breathing animation
2. **Walk**: 4-6 frame walking cycle
3. **Jump Start**: Crouching preparation frame
4. **Jump Air**: Mid-air pose with arms/legs positioned
5. **Jump Land**: Landing recovery frame
